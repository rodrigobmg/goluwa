Goluwa (good luck warrior) is a 3d "engine" written in Lua. 

It uses LuaJIT's ffi api to bind OpenGL and all the availible extensions.

There's a few libraries as well such as a virtual file system, sockets, event handler, timers, addons (inspired by source engine).

Goluwa's structure is inspired by garrys mod.
