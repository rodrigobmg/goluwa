Goluwa is a game engine written in LuaJIT. It includes high level libraries to render graphics (opengl), play audio (openal soft), handle input, networking and much more. 3D is the main interest but 2D is also important.

The coding style is inspired by Garry's Mod (so also Source Engine), CryEngine and SFML.
